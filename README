Description:
This project implements a files system on a file representing a virtual disk.
This file system can be interacted with using a set of system calls.
zformat - Format a new disk for the oufs file system
zfilez - List all files in a directory in the OU file system
zmkdir - Make a directory in the OU File System
zrmdir - Remove a directory in the OU File System
zinspect - Lists info about the oufs files system. Different commands are as follows

-master
	Displays information about block allocation table and inode allocation table

-inode #
	Displays information about inode number # including type, block pointers, size

-inodee #
	Extended inode query

-dblock #
	Displays information about block number # as though it is a directory

-raw #
	Displays raw hex information about block number #

No known bugs. Assumed that if ZCWD is changed that it is changed to a valid absolute directory path

I worked with Matthew Oakley to develop an understanding of the project and
to develop approaches to the project assignment.
